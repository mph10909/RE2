  title: Theater Employee Log
  body:
  - I'm not sure if anyone will ever read this, but I feel compelled to write down
    what I'm witnessing. As a theater employee, it's my job to keep things running
    smoothly and ensure that the patrons have a pleasant experience. But today, everything
    has gone horribly wrong.
  - The undead monsters have taken over the theater, and I can see them swarming
    through the aisles and attacking anyone in their path. It's a scene straight
    out of a horror movie, but this is real life, and it's happening right in front
    of me.
  - I never thought I would witness something like this. The screams of the patrons
    echo through the theater, and I can see the terror in their eyes as they try
    to escape. But it's too late for most of them.
  - As I watch the chaos unfold, I can't help but think of my own family. Are they
    safe? Have they managed to avoid the same fate as these poor people?
  - I feel helpless, trapped in the theater with no way out. All I can do is watch
    as the monsters overrun everything in their path.
  - Maybe one day someone will find this journal and know what happened here. Maybe
    they'll be able to stop it from happening again.
  - 'But for now, I must focus on survival. It''s all that matters in this moment....
