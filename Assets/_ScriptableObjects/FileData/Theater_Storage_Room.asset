  - 'Journal Entry: May 2, 1998

    

    Today has been a strange day. I''ve
    been tasked with moving movie reels from the east wing to the storage room, but
    there''s something odd going on.'
  - The only time we can access the theater is when it's screening movies, which
    seems unusual. It's as if they're trying to keep us away from something. I can't
    help but wonder what they're hiding.
  - The rumors of a virus spreading through the facility don't help ease my suspicions.
    I'll keep my eyes and ears open, but for now, I'll just focus on getting these
    reels moved before the next screening starts.
