  - 'Date: September 23rd, 2022



    On the evening of September 23rd, 2022, I
    was working at the restaurant as a server when I witnessed a strange incident
    involving the chef and the fryer in the kitchen.'
  - At approximately 7:30 PM, I saw the chef rush out of the storage room, looking
    panicked. He was carrying something in his hand, but I couldn't make out what
    it was. He then proceeded to drop the object into the fryer, causing a loud sizzling
    noise.
  - '

    At first, I thought the chef may have dropped a piece of food into the
    fryer, but the sizzling sound was much louder than usual. Suddenly, the fryer
    burst into flames, causing a small fire to break out in the kitchen.'
  - As a trained employee, I immediately recognized the danger of the situation and
    went to look for the nearest fire extinguisher. While searching for the extinguisher,
    I could see that the fire was quickly spreading and growing more intense.
  - I quickly rushed through the kitchen, trying to find a fire extinguisher. However,
    the flames were growing rapidly, and I couldn't locate one in the immediate vicinity.
    I frantically searched nearby areas, but to no avail.
  - My only hope is to find one in the nearby theater, but I fear that the fire may
    have spread beyond my control by the time I return. What could he have dropped
    in the fryer, what did he see in the storage room.....
