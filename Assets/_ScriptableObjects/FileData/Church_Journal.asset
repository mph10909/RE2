  - 'Journal Entry: April 21, 1998



    It seems like our troubles never cease
    in this godforsaken place. Today, we had a new problem arise in the form of Deacon
    Thomas, who dropped his keys to the church back office down a grate in the floor
    of the wine cellar.

'
  - Unfortunately, he dropped his keys down the grate, and they fell through to a
    lower level. From the looks of it, someone could climb down to retrieve them,
    but they would have to be smaller than Deacon Thomas.
  - "\rJournal Entry: April 24, 1998\r\n\r\nWe're all on high alert here, as strange
    things have been happening in the town lately. People have been disappearing,
    and there have been reports of strange creatures lurking in the shadows.\r\n"
  - We don't know what's going on, but we do know that we need to find those keys.
    They are the only set we have for the back office, and we need to get in there
    to access important documents and supplies.
  - 'Journal Entry: April 27, 1998



    I''m not sure who will be brave enough
    to climb down that grate, but we have to do something. We can''t afford to be
    locked out of the back office, especially with all the strange occurrences happening
    in the town.'
  - I'll update this journal if we find a solution to our problem. Until then, we'll
    have to remain vigilant and do our best to survive in these odd times.
